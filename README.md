# NetheriteElytra
**Spigot 1.16+**

A NetheriteElytra does not burn in lava and lasts twice as long as a regular elytra.

## Custom Textures:
To use this plugin's custom textures, add this link: ``https://github.com/TheDutchMC/NetheriteElytra/raw/master/NetheriteElytra-resource-pack.zip`` to your ``server.properties`` file, at ``resource-pack``.

**Note:** For the texture to show up when you are wearing the elytra, you must use OptiFine!
